                    CLAIM: "Mueller sent more armed FBI agents to arrest Roger Stone for NON VIOLENT charges than the military sent SEALS to get Osama bin Laden. <br><br>"Does that tell you how OUT OF CONTROL Mueller is." — post on Facebook.
                    <br><br>
                    THE FACTS: The claim, which circulated widely on Facebook with photos of longtime President Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone and special counsel Robert Mueller, tries to equate the pre-dawn arrest of Stone with the highly sophisticated secret military mission to apprehend Osama bin Laden. <br><br>On Jan. 25, about 12 FBI agents arrested Stone in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to The Associated Press. <br><br>In contrast, some 48 members of SEAL Team 6 participated in the raid on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan in 2011.

                    According to the AP, two specially engineered Black Hawk helicopters carried "23 SEALs, an interpreter and a tracking dog named Cairo" to the compound under the cover of darkness. <br><br>Nineteen of those SEALS entered the compound. There also were another two dozen SEALs standing by aboard Chinook helicopters. <br><br>Stone has been charged with lying to Congress, obstructing the House intelligence committee's Russia investigation and witness tampering. He has pleaded not guilty.

                  The Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, has claimed he has had held “clandestine” meetings with the military as he attempts to force Nicolás Maduro from power.

              <p>
                Writing in the New York Times, Guaidó said: “The military’s withdrawal of support from Mr Maduro is crucial to enabling a change in government, and the majority of those in service agree that the country’s recent travails are untenable.”
                <br><br>
                Guaidó, a 35-year-old former student leader and head of Venezuela’s opposition-run national assembly, has been in the forefront of a renewed attempt to force Maduro from power since last week when he declared himself Venezuela’s rightful interim president in a daring challenge to the incumbent.
                <br><br>
                Maduro has accused Donald Trump and a “group of extremists around him” of plotting to topple him in order to seize Venezuela’s oil, and warned he risked transforming the South American country into a new Vietnam.

              The results of Google’s latest annual survey on employee satisfaction, which were shared internally in January, offer another sign.

              World War 4 has begun. Apple, which is an important company that makes phones and laptops and software, yanked Google’s enterprise software certificate for iOS, which is the software certificate that lets Google deploy its own internal apps without going through the App Store, thus shutting down all of its betas of Gmail, YouTube, and Maps on iOS and their own internal apps like the one that shows them the menus in the cafe. This literally just happened. It happened minutes before we started taping.
              <br><br>
              This follows the fact that Apple did this to Facebook yesterday. Same situation: yanked the enterprise certificate for Facebook so people can no longer look at their bus schedule or test up builds of Instagram. This is all in response to both Facebook and Google running research apps — user research apps?

              After days of stunningly bitter winter weather that sent temperatures plummeting as low as 56 degrees below zero, paralyzed airline and rail travel, closed schools and businesses and suspended mail delivery in nine states, the worst of this polar vortex invasion is over.
              <br><br>
              At least 18 people have died as a result of the cold and snow.
              <br><br>
              While morning temperatures were still near zero across a wide swath of the nation – including Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo and Burlington, Vt., – the forecast for Friday and into the weekend was downright balmy.
              <br><br>
              “I don’t think there’s ever been a case where we’ve seen (such a big) shift in temperatures” in the winter, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the Weather Underground firm. “Past record-cold waves have not dissipated this quickly. … Here we are going right into spring-like temperatures.”
