                  A rope is an essential tool with which all of us are familiar. <br><br>Ropes are made from strands of fabric, plants, wire, or other materials that are each individually twisted or braided together. Interestingly, substances that may be quite unexceptional can be woven together and become exceptionally strong. Thus, effectively connecting and binding ordinary materials can produce an extraordinary tool.

                Just as a rope obtains its strength from many intertwined individual strands, so the gospel of Jesus Christ provides the greatest perspective of truth and offers the richest blessings as we heed the admonition of Paul to “gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.”<br><br> Importantly, this vital gathering of truth is centered in and focused upon the Lord Jesus Christ because He is “the way, the truth, and the life.”

                    My dear and precious sisters, four months have now passed since I extended my invitation to you to help gather scattered Israel. <br><br>Do you recall how I told you that gathering Israel is “the greatest challenge, the greatest cause, and the greatest work on earth today”? Many of you have seized this challenge with great vigor. I wish to tell you that the Lord loves you and is pleased with every effort you make.

              Many missionaries have traditionally begun their service based on the school year, often leaving during the summer months.<br><br> Yet, according to Elder Nielson, there are some advantages to leaving during non-peak times, especially between November and May.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Missionaries who spend a semester at college or working can gain useful life experiences that will prepare them for service,” Elder Nielson said. <br><br>“They can have more individual attention in the missionary training center and be assigned to a more experienced first companion as they arrive in the field when they leave at a non-peak time.”

              First, think about your life and set your priorities. <br><br>
              Find some quiet time regularly to think deeply about where you are going and what you will need to do to get there. Jesus, our exemplar, often “withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed” (Luke 5:16). <br><br>
              We need to do the same thing occasionally to rejuvenate ourselves spiritually as the Savior did. Write down the tasks you would like to accomplish each day. <br><br>
              Keep foremost in mind the sacred covenants you have made with the Lord as you write down your daily schedules.

              It was a mid-April snowstorm that started it all. Not necessarily an unusual occurrence for Utah, but still, I thought the snow-drenched tulips on Temple Square needed to be documented.<br><br> So I created an Instagram account—one that featured not photos of my cats (as adorable as they are) but rather photos of the temple.

              Thus began a year of daily posting (and a few more years of not-so-daily posting). <br><br>Taking photos of the temple and posting them with temple-related quotes from Church leaders became a fun way to develop talents and deepen my appreciation for the temple.
