              Caesars Entertainment Corp.’s longtime rewards program is being renamed for the company’s namesake.
<br><br>
The company’s Total Rewards program will be known as Caesars Rewards as of Friday, company officials said Wednesday. The name change was first announced in December.
<br><br>
The company said the loyalty program is the oldest in the casino industry, starting in 2005 when Harrah’s Entertainment merged with Caesars Entertainment and absorbed that company’s “Connection Card” program.
<br><br>
The company’s 55 million members will have their accounts changed automatically on Friday and benefits and award tiers will remain the same.</p>
